# Demonstration
The shift towards cloud-native applications allows application developers to package their applications consistently between development and production, and helps them scale their deployments horizontally across a large pool of compute resources more quickly.

In contrast to other cloud-native approaches - like Platform-as-a-Service with Heroku or Cloud Foundry - container orchestration system like Kubernetes are "less-opinionated" and offer a great amount of flexibility at the cost of a single prescribed set of guidelines, which can make them more attractive to those migrating from a virtual machine or bare metal approach rather than towards PaaS directly.

This PoC shows how one might migrate a traditional web-server, application-server, and database-server based application into a container-based model that depends on cloud services in order to speed application development by reducing time spent on managing servers across a large deployment target environment.

## 1. Functional Drupal site running on the IBM Cloud
A managed Kubernetes cluster provided by the IBM Cloud Container Service provides the fabric on which to install a set of NGINX and PHP-FPM containers. These containers can encapsulate what's needed to run Drupal and the underlying Kubernetes fabric can bind those containers to data services, load balancers, and storage volumes provided by the IBM Cloud declaratively.

### 1.1 Initial environment setup
The [initial setup](INITIAL-SETUP.md) instructions show how to provision a Kubernetes cluster and the MySQL, Redis, and Memcached services needed by the Drupal cluster.

### 1.2 First container cluster deployment
Once the fabric and services are configured, you can build container images and deploy them to the IBM Container Service. The [container deployment instructions](DEPLOY-CONTAINERS.md) describe how.

## 2. Clearly defined and easy to implement process for pushing code updates
Once the initial environment is set up, you can initiate additional build, test, and deploy workflows by committing code to specific folders in this repository. This simulates GitHub or BitBucket web hooks.

### 2.1 Updating the underlying NGINX and PHP container images
You can commit updated NGINX or PHP version files to the `config` directory. This will in turn trigger base image rebuilds, and in turn rebuild custom `code` images on top and deploy them.

### 2.2 Updating custom code and triggering code layer rebuilds
You can commit code that should be layered on top of base NGINX, PHP, and Drupal installation by changing code in the `code` directory. This will trigger a custom code rebuild and deploy.

## 3. Synchronize or migrate one database to another database
Ongoing management of the Drupal cluster can be performed with arbitrary shell commands and `drush` commands invoked by logging into the PHP-CLI container. This container could also be extended to run arbitrary commands on startup.

### 3.1. Using the PHP CLI container to execute arbitrary commands
You can exec into the PHP CLI container to [run arbitrary bash or MySQL commands as well as those injected from the `code` directory](PHP-CLI-DRUSH.md).

### 3.2. Using the PHP CLI container to execute Drush commands
You can exec into the PHP CLI container to [run arbitrary `drush` commands as well as those injected from the `code/drush` directory](PHP-CLI-DRUSH.md).

## 4. Taking advantage of a continous integration pipeline
The [pipeline setup instructions](PIPELINE-SETUP.md) show how IBM DevOps can be used with user-defined scripts and webhooks to initiate build, test, and deployment flows. These can incorporate unit test scripts, security vulnerability assessments, and blue/green rolling deploys. These workflows can reuse build tool Docker images as well, which is a new feature of IBM DevOps services.
